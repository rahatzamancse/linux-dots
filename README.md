# TL;DR
 The summary of what I am using is given below.

- autostart desktop files
- conky` config files
- neofetch
- nvim (with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug))
- rofi
- zsh

- some custom scripts in `~/.local/share/bin`

The overall flow of how you login and how all the scripts are ran is shown in the below picture.
